6.837 final project particle-based fluid simulation, William Caruso &amp; Harrison Wang

## Plan of Action

### Phase 1

The goal of Phase 1 is to show fluid-like particle interaction with a small amount of particles (100). We will need to calculate particle-particle interactions over all of the remaining particles (expensive but small amount of particles). 

This involves the following:

* 10 x 10 grid of particles (Particle, Particle System classes)
* Container (Wall class))
* compute acceleration
* compute density pressure

### Phase 2
